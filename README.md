# Whitewinequality

The objective of the Wine Quality dataset is to predict the quality of different wines based on various physicochemical properties. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the wine quality based on the input features.

The input features (independent variables) in the dataset include properties like:
Fixed acidity, Volatile acidity, Citric acid, Residual sugar, Chlorides, Free sulfur dioxide, Total sulfur dioxide, Density, pH, Sulphates, Alcohol. The target variable (dependent variable) is:
Quality (score between 0 and 10)
